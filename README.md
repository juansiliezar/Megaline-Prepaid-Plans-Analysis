# Project: Megaline Prepaid Plans Analysis

## Introduction:

Hey there! I'm excited to welcome you to the Megaline Prepaid Plans Analysis project. My goal is to help Megaline fine-tune their advertising budget by figuring out which prepaid plan—Surf or Ultimate—brings in more revenue. In this initial analysis, I'll be digging into the data of 500 Megaline clients. We'll explore their demographics, plan usage, and communication behavior, looking at calls, text messages, and internet usage throughout the year 2018. My aim is to derive actionable insights that can guide their marketing strategies and boost revenue generation. Join me on this data-driven journey as we uncover the narrative behind Megaline's prepaid plans.
