# Megaline Prepaid Plans Analysis

## Introduction:

In my role as a data analyst, I am currently engaged in a project with Megaline, a prominent telecommunications company. The project aims to optimize the company's advertising budget by discerning which of their prepaid cellular plans, namely Surf or Ultimate, generates higher revenue. This analysis is crucial for Megaline's commercial department to strategically allocate resources and enhance revenue streams.

## Project Overview:

Megaline provides two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, catering to diverse consumer needs. The commercial department seeks insights into the revenue generated by each plan to refine their marketing strategies effectively. To address this, I am conducting a preliminary analysis leveraging data from 500 Megaline clients spanning the year 2018. This analysis delves into clients' demographics, plan usage patterns, and communication behaviors, encompassing calls, text messages, and internet usage.

## Methodology:

The project unfolds in several systematic steps outlined by Megaline's project instructions:

Data Preparation: I begin by meticulously preparing the provided datasets, ensuring accuracy and consistency. This involves converting data into appropriate types and rectifying any errors present within the datasets.

Behavioral Analysis: Next, I delve into analyzing clients' behavior patterns, dissecting the usage metrics such as minutes of calls, volume of texts, and data consumption per month for each plan. Mean, variance, and standard deviation calculations are performed, and histograms are plotted to visualize the distributions of these metrics.

Hypothesis Testing: I proceed to test two key hypotheses:

Whether the average revenue from users of Ultimate and Surf plans differs significantly.
Whether the average revenue from users in the NY-NJ area differs significantly from users in other regions.
Conclusion: Finally, I synthesize the findings and insights derived from the analysis into a comprehensive conclusion. This conclusion serves as a guidepost for Megaline's strategic decision-making process regarding advertising budget allocation.

## Conclusion:

This project encapsulates a meticulous examination of Megaline's prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, with the overarching goal of optimizing advertising budget allocation. By scrutinizing clients' behavior and testing pertinent hypotheses, this analysis aims to furnish actionable insights that empower Megaline to bolster its revenue generation strategies effectively. Through this endeavor, I endeavor to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis and contribute meaningfully to Megaline's strategic objectives.
