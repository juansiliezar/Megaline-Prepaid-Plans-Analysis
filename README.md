# Megaline Prepaid Plans Analysis

## Introduction:

Hey there! Today, my goal is to help Megaline, a telecommunications company, fine-tune their advertising budget by figuring out which of their prepaid plans — _Surf or Ultimate_ — brings in more revenue. In this initial analysis, I'll be digging into the data of 500 Megaline clients. We'll explore their demographics, plan usage, and communication behavior, looking at calls, text messages, and internet usage throughout the year 2018. My aim is to derive actionable insights that can guide their marketing strategies and boost revenue generation. Join me on this data-driven journey as we uncover the narrative behind Megaline's prepaid plans.
